# homebridge-scout

A [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) plug-in that enables HomeKit integration for the [Scout](https://scoutalarm.com/) security system.

## Installation

1. [Install Homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge#installation).

2. Install this plug-in: `npm install -g homebridge-scout`

3. Update your Homebridge configuration file (`~/.homebridge/config.json`). See configuration options below.

## Configuration

### Options

All of the following configuration options are required. If any are missing or invalid, Homebridge will fail to start with an error message describing the problem.

* **`platform`:** Must be `ScoutAlarm`.
* **`auth`:** Your Scout login credentials. I recommend setting up a new non-administrator user for this purpose.
  * **`email`:** Your Scout email.
  * **`password`:** Your Scout password. Don't forget to slash-escape any quotes.
* **`location`:** The name of your Scout location. It's probably `Home` if you only have one Scout system and haven't renamed it. You can find this in the left-hand menu of the Scout app or dashboard.
* **`modes`:** These map the HomeKit modes to your Scout modes. These can also be found in the left-hand menu of the Scout app or dashboard.
  * **`stay`:** Probably `Home`.
  * **`away`:** Probably `Away`.
  * **`night`:** You may not have one. I recommend adding one to your Scout system if you don't, but you *can* use the same value you did for `stay` here.

### Example

Update the `platforms` section of your `~/.homebridge/config.json`:

```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "ScoutAlarm",
      "auth": {
        "email": "email@example.com",
        "password": "password123"
      },
      "location": "Home",
      "modes": {
        "stay": "Home",
        "away": "Away",
        "night": "Night"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Device Support

The plug-in currently offers support for the hub and any of the connected device types:

* door panel
* access sensor
* smoke alarm

If you have device types that are not yet supported (water sensors, motion sensors, etc.), let me know (via issues). I'd love to add support for the remaining device types â€” I just don't own them personally, so I can't test them.
